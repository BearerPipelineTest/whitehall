    # We need to set `sort_buffer_size` to work around a bug in MySQL 8.0.27 [1]
    # This quadruples the default sort buffer size, which seems to provide enough headroom to allow sorting to work correctly with our dataset.
    # The bug is fixed in MySQL 8.0.28 (currently unreleased), so we should be able to remove this fix once we're on that version.
